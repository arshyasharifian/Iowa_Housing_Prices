This repo showcases how to use a jupyter notebook to analyze a dataset and build some out of the box machine learning models.

### Pre-requisites to running the jupyter notebook called "mynotebook":
- Python version 3 and above
- Jupyter Notebook

# note: while you are executing the python scripts, if you notice an error regarding a package not being found, use this link to properly install all the packages necessary to run the scripts.  If you see a line of code with "import", this means you likely need to pip install that package.  

First make sure you have python by opening terminal and type to check the version:

> python -V

You should see the python version you have installed on your machine: 3.x.y (where x and y are some subversion of version 3).
If you don't see version 3, download it here (github.com)
