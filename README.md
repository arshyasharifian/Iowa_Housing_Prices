This repo showcases how to use a jupyter notebook to analyze a dataset and build some out of the box machine learning models.

### Pre-requisites to running the jupyter notebook called "mynotebook":
- Python version 3 and above
- Jupyter Notebook

###### note: I am assuming your are using a mac. If you are using some other operating system, you need to search for the same commands for your system.

###### note: while you are executing the python scripts, if you notice an error regarding a package not being found, use this link to properly install all the packages necessary to run the scripts.  If you see a line of code with "import", this means you likely need to pip install that package.  

First make sure you have python by opening terminal and type to check the version:

> python -V

You should see the python version you have installed on your machine: 3.x.y (where x and y are some subversion of version 3).
If you don't see version 3, download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Next, make sure you have downloaded and installed jupyter notebook. To check simply open your terminal and change directory (cd) until you reach a folder you are familiar with and enter the following:

> jupyter notebook

This should automatically open your jupyter notebook in your default browser at the location of localhost:8888.  If you don't see this then follow [these instructions to install and configure your notebook](https://jupyter.org/install).  

###### note: jupyter lab is the upgraded jupyter notebook, and you might want to try to install and configure jupyter lab instead of jupyter notebook but up to you.

### Download and Run the jupyter notebook

After you have completed the pre-requisite steps, simply download the jupyter notebook called "my_notebook" and run all the scripts by hitting the __Shift + Enter__ keys, or you can navigate to the top of the jupyter notebook and hitting the run button.
